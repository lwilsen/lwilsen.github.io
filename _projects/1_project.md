This is a data science/visualization project that focuses on using pulled ADS-B data to identify airports in Florida, and to track the flight paths of specific flights. The code can be adapted to anywhere in the world where ADS-B data is available.

This app depends on having an API key from the Sentinal satellite imagery API. You'll need to create an account with them, but they have a free 30 day trial which is what I used to make this app. (https://www.sentinel-hub.com/develop/api/)

Final Presentation of the IEX Data Science Syllabus. [Final Project](https://github.com/lwilsen/IEX_final_project)

The four main components of the Data Science Internship were:
1. Prediction of Titanic Survivors
2. Price Prediction of Houses in Ames Iowa
3. Sentiment Analysis (Specifically of IMDB Movie Reviews)
4. MNIST Handwritten Digit classification

This app contains a sqlite3 database, a flask api backend, and a streamlit frontend.

The app allows users to:
1. Input individual characteristics and see if they would be predicted to have survived the titanic sinking.
2. Input house characteristcs and see what the predicted price would be
3. Write text and have it be classified as positive or negative (sentiment-wise).
4. Draw a handwritten digit using a streamlit canvas, and have that number be classified.

This repo is based on Renu Ghering's HealthCareAnalysis that was created with the intent of testing data science methods on synthetic Medicare and Medicaid data.

I'm going to be exploring this data based on her teaching's as a part of an independent study for my Master's in Biostatistics.

Currently, I'm cleaning and preprocessing the data, as well as coming up with potential research questions.

My main focus right now is on the prediction of length of stay for patients, and on the classification of patients as high or low risk/severity. 

I'm also very interested in trying to encorporate heirarchical models into this problem.

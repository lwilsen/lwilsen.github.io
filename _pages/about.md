I am a second year Master's student of Biostatistics at The School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst. I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to actuate meaningful results. I'm committed to delivering results with a focused attention to detail, and a strong background in data analytics, biostatistics, and machine learning. 

I've been able to apply these skills and gain experience through my internship at Dimensional Insight, a high-tech healthcare analytics company in Massachusetts, where I created complex analytic applications used to drive actionable results in hospital systems throughout the country. I have a strong foundation in python and R, which I have used to clean and analyze complex datasets to create statistical reports analyzing healthcare data at a county level.

As a highly adaptable and project oriented professional, I thrive in diverse and unfamiliar environments and constantly seek to push myself and improve my skills. I am passionate about using my skills to improve health outcomes for people across the world, and am excited to contribute my experience and expertise to projects focused on biostatistical research and health outcomes.

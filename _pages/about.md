ðŸ”¬ Data Scientist | Biostatistics MS | Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast

I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning, predictive modeling, and AI-driven decision support. Currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Biostatistics at UMass Amherst, I thrive at the intersection of data science and healthcare analytics, leveraging statistical models and machine learning techniques to drive meaningful insights.

My professional experience spans healthcare analytics, AI-driven modeling, and MLOps. At Iron Eagle X, I built and deployed machine learning pipelines using PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Docker, applying deep learning and NLP techniques to complex datasets. As a Statistical Consultant at Prapela, I conducted statistical analyses that contributed to an FDA De Novo classification submission for a breakthrough medical device. My work at Dimensional Insight involved developing pricing and revenue analytics dashboards, improving data-driven decision-making for hospital systems.

I specialize in:
âœ… Machine Learning & AI: Deep Learning, NLP, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
âœ… MLOps & Deployment: FastAPI, Docker, Streamlit, Flask
âœ… Statistical Modeling & Biostatistics: Predictive Analytics, Python, R
âœ… Healthcare & Fitness Data Science: Clinical Research, Time-Series Analysis

I am passionate about using data to improve health outcomes and optimize human performance. Whether itâ€™s developing AI models to enhance healthcare analytics or applying statistical insights to fitness technology, I am eager to contribute to projects that make a tangible impact.
